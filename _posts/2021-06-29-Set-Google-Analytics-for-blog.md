### What is Google Analytics?

![GoogleAnalytics](/img/in-post/google_analytics.png)

Google Analytics is a platform that can help developers and business owners to collect and analyze data. Take my tech blog as an example. I am most interested in data related to:

- Which article has the highest click-through rate? 
- People in which area are most interested in my article? 
- Which page did my readers spend most time on? 

For business owners running online business, the data that they are interested in might be: 

- Which product page gets the most clicks? 
- Which is the best selling product? 
- Which is the most popular referral site of the online store? 

All these data can be collected through Google Analytics, and generate reports for display. 

### Why choose Google Analytics?

Because it is free!
Google offers both free and paid version of Google Analytics. Small businesses (or my tech blog) can choose the service without paying any recurring fee. But if users want more advanced services, they need to choose premium version Google Analytics 360.

### Universal Analytics(GA3) or GA4?
Google Analytics 4 is not an upgrade of Universal Analytics. It is a completely new version of Google analytics with different sets of reports.
Google Analytics 4 is the future of Google Analytics!

*5 Key Advantages of GA4 compared with GA3:*
1. Machine learning -- GA4 can generate automatic insights and predictable insights based on Google's new machine learning technology.
2. Cross-device/platform -- More robust and reliable cross-device and cross-platform tracking.
3. Event tracking automation -- GA4 automatically tracks for certain types of events (e.g. scroll, video engagement, site search etc.).
4. BigQuery -- GA4 comes with a Free connection to BigQuery(Cloud data warehouse).
5. Built-in IP anonymization feature -- GA4 pays more attention to end user privacy.

However, there are also comments showing that the user interface and data reports of GA4 are more complicated. For users who only host a website without an APP, some new features are not useful to them at all. So if you are already familiar with GA3 user interface, I would suggest you think twice before replacing GA3 with GA4. In summary, whether you want to replace GA3 with the new version GA4 depends on your personal needs and interests.
