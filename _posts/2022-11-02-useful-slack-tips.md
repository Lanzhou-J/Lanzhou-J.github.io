    - If asking for help, follow this template:
      - "I'm trying to do..."
      - "I did A and I expected B to happen, but instead ..."
      - "I've tried X, Y and Z to fix it, but ..."
      - "Could this be because of ...?"
      - (These are also good questions to ask yourself to organize your thoughts when debugging!)
